# reffectory

A Clojure/ClojureScript framework designed to provide a full events system with effects
and coeffects inspired by [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame)'s one.

reffectory is the core of re-om, the library we're using to introduce [re-frame's event-driven architecture](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame#why-should-you-care)
into a legacy ClojureScript application that uses [Om](https://github.com/omcljs/om).

We extracted reffectory from re-om and made it also work for Clojure in the hope that more people
might find it interesting to build Clojure and ClojureScript libraries and/or applications on top of it.

## Usage

We'll grow reffectory and re-om's documentation bit by bit in the next following months.
